Subject: Spam Protection Added to Contact Forms

Dear [Client Name],

I've implemented automatic spam filtering for all your contact forms.

## What's New
✅ **Automatic spam detection** - Promotional messages are now filtered out
✅ **Clean CRM** - No more spam cluttering your lead management
✅ **Seamless experience** - Users still see success messages

## What Gets Blocked
- Promotional messages (Google reviews, SEO services, etc.)
- Messages with excessive emojis and phone numbers
- Service listings and guarantee promises

## What Gets Through
- All legitimate property inquiries
- Business partnership requests
- General questions

The system works automatically in the background - no action needed on your end. It prioritizes not losing real clients, so some spam might still get through, but your CRM will be much cleaner.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
